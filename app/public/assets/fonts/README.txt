Please download the Shrikhand font files (WOFF2/WOFF) and place them in this folder.

Recommended files and names:
- Shrikhand-Regular.woff2
- Shrikhand-Regular.woff

Where to get them:
- https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Shrikhand (use the download family button and extract the .woff/.woff2 files)

After placing the files here, restart your dev server if needed. The CSS already references:
- /assets/fonts/Shrikhand-Regular.woff2
- /assets/fonts/Shrikhand-Regular.woff

If you want me to add the files for you, upload the .woff/.woff2 files here or paste their base64 content and I can create them in this folder.
